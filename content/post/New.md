There are a few changes to the main view of RsyncOSX in the December 2020 release of RsyncOSX. I am working on a more clean version as well as preparation for a SwiftUI based version of RsyncOSX (in 2021). The views in the new versions are cleaned up. And there is introduced a sidebar for most used actions.

There will be released two versions in December:

- a "default" version with slide to execute and delete
- a cleaned up version, which will be the base for a SwiftUI version of RsyncOSX

## Default view

The main view is cleaned up a little bit. The status field is removed.

Using either two fingers on the touchpad or a finger on the mouse, slide to the left will execute a single task. If the task is estimated a progressbar will pop up.

Sliding to the right will delete a record. Every delete must be confirmed before delete.

If a task is estimated a green bullet is shown.

## Cleaned up view

Almost all of the labels with info are removed. The info is available by shortcuts. There is also a new sidebar with most relevant actions for each screen.
