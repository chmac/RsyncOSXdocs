There will also in the future be a native Swift based version of RsyncOSX. But I have commenced to investigate if there is a possibilty to make a new, [cross-plattform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) version of RsyncOSX. This is a project for next year, but I am starting to look around how to do it and with what dev tools. The following tools and language is in my focus now. Applications like [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) is an Electron based app written in TypeScript and uses React. So why not RsyncOSX as well?
- [Wikipedia, TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)
- [www.typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [www.electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

Developing applications with the above tools are quite different from using Swift. I have for the moment, no idea if it will work or when something is running. But it seems like a compelling idea and I will spend some time investigating how and if it is possible.

The above is for the moment an idea. I dont know if I am able to do it or how to do it, but it is like the start of RsyncOSX a possible project to learn how to make cross-plattform apps by using modern open-source language and tools.
