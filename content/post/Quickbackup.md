There are three options for executing several synchroniz tasks. The three toolbar buttons are:

- ![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/synchronize/backupnow.png) search for all tasks with files to synchronize and execute

The above can also be executed by the `⌘B` shortcut.

- ![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/synchronize/quickbackup.png) do an estimation run and present which tasks with files to be synchronized

The above can also be executed by the `⌘T` shortcut.

- ![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/synchronize/batch.png) as above, but for the selected tasks

You can also select a task and by the `⌘R` shortcut execute that task. A double click on a task executes an estimation run and shows the result of the estimation.
