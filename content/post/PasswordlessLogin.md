To enable passwordless login by using ssh you must use ssh-keygen to create a private and public key-pair. The method below is a manually setup. [RsyncOSX does also assist in setting up ssh-keys.](/post/ssh/)

## Step by step procedure

If the server is set up listening for ssh on other ports than standard port 22 use ssh -p port to use another port. In RsyncOSX there is in parameters setting possible to set another ssh port if required. The Mac$ is a abbreviation for the terminal prompt.

**Step 1** : create a ssh-keypair on your Mac (from the terminal window) and just press Enter every time ssh-keygen ask for input (three times).
```
ssh-足keygen -足t rsa
```
See comment on ssh-keygen below (about RSA or DSA based crypto).

**Step 2** : login to your server and create a .ssh directory in your home catalog. The instructions are **four commands**, first login, then cd then mkdir and last exit.
```
ssh user@server.com
cd
mkdir .ssh
exit
```
**Step 3** : copy through ssh the public key from the Mac .ssh directory to the server.
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@server.com "cat > .ssh/authorized_keys"
```
or use secure copy
```
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server.com:.ssh/authorized_keys
```
**Step 4** : login in to user@server.com and set the correct permissions for the .ssh catalog and authorized_keys file.

```
ssh user@server.com
cd
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
exit
```
**Step 5** : test login from Mac, password is not required.
```
ssh user@server.com
```
If you have two or more servers repeat step 2 - step 5.

### Comment on ssh-keygen

My knowledge of crypto is very limited. The parameter -t rsa creates one key-pair based on [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)). It might be that your server require a key-pair based on [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm). The following steps creates a key-pair based on DSA (parameter -t dsa):

**Step 1**: create a ssh-keypair on your Mac (from the terminal window) and just press Enter every time ssh-keygen ask for input (three times).
```
ssh-足keygen -足t dsa
```
**Step 2**: login to your server and create a .ssh directory in your home catalog. The instructions are **four commands**, first login, then cd then mkdir and exit.
```
ssh user@server.com cd mkdir .ssh exit
```
**Step 3** copy through ssh the public key from the Mac .ssh directory to the server.
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh user@server.com "cat > .ssh/authorized_keys2"
```
or use secure copy
```
scp ~/scp .ssh/id_dsa.pub user@server.com:.ssh/authorized_keys2
```
**Step 4**: login in to user@server.com and set the correct permissions for the .ssh catalog and authorized_keys2 file.
```
ssh user@server.com
cd
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys2
exit
```
**Step 5**: test login from Mac, password is not required.
```
ssh user@server.com
```
