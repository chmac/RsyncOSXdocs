My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncOSX. The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift. The first version was released in March 2016 and I have learned a lot since then. The codebase for RsyncOSX today is also very different from the very start.

I do hold a degree in computing science, but I am not a professional developer nor do I want to be one either. I am a senior employee, grand dad to three and has commenced the planning of early retirement. My development of RsyncOSX will still be one of my fun hobbies and I will continue to work on it as long as there are users out there using it. I am a passionate mac user and I will continue to read and keep med updated on IT-technology.

If you like using RsyncOSX please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

### Applications

There are four MacOS applications:

- [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX) a GUI for rsync
- [The menuapp](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched) for executing scheduled RsyncOSX tasks
- [RsyncGUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncGUI) an Apple Sandboxed version of RsyncOSX
- [RcloneOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx) a GUI for rclone

All applications are compiled with support for macOS 10.11 - latest version of macOS.
