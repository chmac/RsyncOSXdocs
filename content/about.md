My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncOSX. The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift. And I am still learning, every day. The first version of RsyncOSX was released in March 2016 and there has been a few changes since then.

I do hold a degree in computing science, but I am **not a professional developer**. I am a senior employee (administration) at a university, grand dad to three and has commenced the planning of early retirement. RsyncOSX is not a professional software. There is only one developer, me, and I am doing what I can to keep RsyncOSX as stable and userfriendly. I am not a UI designer and some user might find the GUI of RsyncOSX complicated and less userfriendly.

The development of RsyncOSX will continue to be one of my prioritized hobbies. A long as there are users of it I will continue developing.  If you like using RsyncOSX please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

### Applications

There are four MacOS applications:

- [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX) a GUI for rsync
- [The menuapp](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched) for executing scheduled RsyncOSX tasks
- [RsyncGUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncGUI) an Apple Sandboxed version of RsyncOSX
- [RcloneOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx) a GUI for rclone

All applications are compiled with support for macOS 10.14 - latest version of macOS.
