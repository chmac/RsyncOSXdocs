The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a project to learn Swift. The first version was released in March 2016. If you like using RsyncOSX please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.
